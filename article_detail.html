        There is so much that is distressing about the case of JS, the 14-year-old girl with terminal cancer who wished
        to be cryonically preserved after death, in the hope that she could be revived when a cure for her rare illness
        had been discovered. Her mother supported the girl in her wishes; her estranged father did not. So, without the
        consent of both parents, the child had to apply to the courts for permission for the procedure to take place.

        JS and her mother both seem to have been determined to secure the preservation. JS got in touch with a Michigan
        storage facility and also with a UK charity that offers cryonic preservation and makes travel arrangements. Her
        maternal grandparents raised the estimated £37,000 to fund the process. After the death of JS, her hospital sent
        a note to the court, saying that their patient’s mother had been too preoccupied with complex postmortem
        arrangements to be “fully available” for her daughter as she died.

        It seems cruel, placing that observation in the public domain, in reference to a woman whose daughter lost her
        life just a month ago. A lot of people will be familiar with the weird displacement activities that are indulged
        when a relative is dying. As my father died of cancer, his family fretted over whether he was eating enough and
        drinking enough water. The last time I offered Dad water, he said to me, very crossly: “Deborah. Enough.”

        When my mother was dying of cancer, I got rid of the piano to make space for a bed in the living room, called
        private ambulance companies and contacted local hospices and care homes, trying with immense futility to arrange
        for her to be brought the 400 miles from Airdrie to London. Would I allow myself to be taken over by my child’s
        fantasy of future life? I fear I might.

        How easy things were when we all agreed that all good children – and adults – go to heaven. My parents had
        always seemed to me very pragmatic in their atheism and their belief that this life was all there was. I was
        hugely shocked when my father, faced with his own death, said: “I didn’t think this would happen to me.” If
        anything, I was even more shocked when my mother said the same thing, just six years later. I’d had cancer
        myself in the interim, and had stared hard at the prospect of my own death. I’m absolutely certain that it’s
        going to happen to me. My doleful preoccupation is with how long I’ve got.

        As for the father in the case, who also has cancer, he seems to be the ultimate example of a man who is clever
        but not wise. His objections included worries that she might be revived in the future and be unhappy and
        isolated. He thought it through. Unbelievable, really. He took a dying child’s complete fantasy, of a rebirth
        that medical science does not offer and is never likely to, imagined how things might pan out if this wasn’t a
        fantasy, and decided he was going to deny his child because his verson of this fantasy didn’t end happily. Also,
        he’s on benefits, and expressed concern about becoming liable for costs.

        Yet one feels for this man too. Even this brief vignette of his psyche explains why he was bitterly estranged
        from his wife and daughter. Neither mother nor child had seen him for many years. Yet still, when they asked
        something of him in their baleful situation, he said no. Eventually he came round, saying he would agree if he
        could see his daughter’s body after she died; they said no, in turn. That’s how high-conflict family fractures
        go: one person says no and the other says no right back, the first chance they get.

        It’s possible too, that it was the need for a court order that made the whole thing real to the mother and
        daughter, encouraged them to pin down details, check out logistics, make costings, seek funding. The case has
        certainly made things real for the rest of us.

        The judge in the case, Mr Justice Peter Jackson, was at pains to emphasise that in granting permission he was
        not endorsing cryonics. Rather, he suggested that there was a need for regulation to be drawn up. I can’t help
        feeling that the regulation of a few exploitative, science fiction-based companies can only give an imprimatur
        of seriousness to ghastly people who exploit the human fear of death. These places don’t need regulating. They
        need exposing as morbid confidence tricksters.

        In the absence of religion, humans still have philosophy to help those in distress make sense of life and death.
        At its best, religion is just a theatrical version of philosophy with a comforting final act. Even the
        resolutely irreligious understand the importance of a funeral – because funerals are for the living.

        That’s why it’s easy to see the mother as even more tragic than the daughter. Perhaps she believed in her
        daughter’s fantasy too. In that case, she is likely to spend the rest of her life tracking progress in the
        treatment of her daughter’s illness. If that cure ever comes, this might be the point at which she will have to
        accept that her child is really dead. It’s a miserable thought. One can only hope that she knew what she was
        doing – offering false but compassionate hope to a child who didn’t want to die.
